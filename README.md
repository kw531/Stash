# Stash
A yarn stash inventory android app. Made for CS 449 - Software Engineering, spring 2017

It's simple to use.  Click on the menu button to add or sort the yarn in inventory.  The yarn is saved to a SQLite database, so it won't be deleted every time you open the app. Long click on an existing yarn to edit or delete this yarn.
